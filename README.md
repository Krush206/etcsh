# etcsh

etcsh is a project envisioning enhancements and fixes over the original tcsh.

Notable features over the original tcsh are

• function declarations;

• variable assignment from pipes and redirections;

• comments on interactive sessions;

• tell whether `stdin` is empty or not;

• variable expansion on expressions corrected;

• piped built-ins are forked;

• missing `test` built-in implemented;

• read-write variable flag;

• `exit` shall cancel lists.

More is to come. Feedbacks and contributions are much appreciated.
